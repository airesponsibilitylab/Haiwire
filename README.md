A CLI implementation of IQT's HAIWire game, ported by Mission Control AI.

Developed for Python3.10

- Press Enter or Return on your keyboard when prompted to in order to advance through the game.
- Timers have been removed so that the host can manually set timers on a seperate device.
- The game reboots automatically once done.
- Use the interrupt/cancel keyboard combo to end the game.

Game boots as python3 Haiwire.py
